    <h1>My first website in months</h1>
    <p>It has been a long time since last write any code, even portugol, c language, or even html (that it's not even a programming language actually), so, here we go, back to work.</p>
    <h2>Web Development full-stack course</h2>
    <p>I was thinking about my studies, and I came to conclusion that I probably drop my studies (with no motivation to back so far) because I didn't have a  good incentive to continue, I was only studying by videos on Youtube, and now, I'm getting back to study, and I bought a Web Development Course from Udemy, by Dr Angela Yu, and I have my reasons for that.</p>
    <ol>
        <q><i>look, I still know how to make an ordered list XD (also quotes and italic)</i></q>
        <li>In Udemy, the courses are planned, there is a begging, mid, and end, you are gradually progressing, you can see your progress, and plus, you've the right exercises and also projects, otherwise from Youtube, that you learn from solo videos, in the best way, you have a playlist, but isn't good enough.</li>
        <li>I've all the content necessary to know the basis of web development, including complementary content.</li>
        <li>Like I already said, there are exercise, i'll not be all the time in the theory of video, or even text based, I'll pratice with real problems, build projects by my own, and all of this, according of my progress, not more than I already know.</li>
        <li>And plus, i'll practice my english. I always have the problem of be afraid of watch videos in english, especially videos of studies, and even more especially, the ones about programming, but now, I'm gonna overcome that, and also learn more and more, until became almost a native. This is one of the parts that more make sense, because my goal (and also my dream) is to work here in Brazil, but by home-office, to foreign companies</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>This is all, fellas</h2>
    <p>Well, I think I made my argument, and also praticed two things that was very rusty (my english and programming ability) at same time, so I'm already proud, the most important step, is the first.</p>
